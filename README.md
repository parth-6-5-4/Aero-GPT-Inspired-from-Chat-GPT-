# Aero GPTi (An inspiration from chat GPT)

aim of creating Aero GPTi is to test the multi persona and implement it in the actual upcomning project that i'm working on that is Project Aero 
which will be a SLM based chatbot with multiple personas and light enough to work on everyday devices locally so as to allow seamless access to a companion/ coach / mentor / buddy at anytime anywhere without internet
